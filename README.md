# FedMalDet
Apply Federated Learning and Deep Learning in detecting malware

Project Objective:
The project aims to learn collaborative analysis in Windows malware analysis. It proposes detecting malware affecting Windows using Federated learning while ensuring data security. By combining Machine Learning for Windows malware detection, the project strives to achieve higher accuracy in malware detection.

Project Description:
While ensuring data security, the project suggests using Federated learning to detect malware affecting Windows. By combining Machine Learning for Windows malware detection, it aims to achieve higher accuracy in detecting malware.

Key Points of Focus:
Compared to the conventional method of copying data from each terminal to the server for model training, Federated learning maximizes the utilization of data resources on each terminal while ensuring information security. By adopting this approach, it becomes possible to train the model with higher accuracy.
